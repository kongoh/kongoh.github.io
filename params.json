{"name":"Kongoh Games","tagline":"bringing the funk back.","body":"KongOh Games is an independent game studio comprised of two members - Kenny Kong and Peter Oh. United by a love for b-boying, our mission is to bring the funk back to gaming. We use hip-hop, funk, and soul music as inspiration and hope to transport players to a time when big hair, outrageous sunglasses, and letting it loose on the dance floor was the thing to do.\r\n\r\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/kongohgames\r\n\r\ntwitter: http://www.twitter.com/kongohgames\r\n","google":"UA-52843101-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
